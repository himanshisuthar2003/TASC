Our project aims to create a digital management system for specialized secret agencies such as the one we have named here Threat Analysis and Surveillance Cell. The project can ease the day-to-day tasks of the officers, no need to keep and update the registers for maintaining the records and database when they can do it digitally. All the proper columns are made in the project along with the connections with the database. All the data gets stored in the database and moreover the project is safe and secure as it is password protected. Only the registered officers can login and function the portal. Admins can only add new officers and new admins. In case any officer forgets the password then they can request for their password but no password reset link is been sent to any type of contact or email, hence, the website is safe and secure. The user can add new records or search from the previous records using the unique record Id or view all the records together in a tabular form.
